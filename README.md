# Advent of Code 2021

Advent of Code is a month long coding challenge, where a new puzzle appears every day, runing during the month of December. All the information about this event can be found in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about). 

This repo constains my solutions, using the Julia programing language, to the puzzles of the 2021 edition.
